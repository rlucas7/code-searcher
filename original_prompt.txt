"""Given a query and a passage, you must provide a score on an\n
integer scale of 0 to 1 with the following meanings:\n
0 = represent that the passage has nothing to do with the query,\n
0 = represents that the passage seems related to the query but\n
does not answer it,\n
1 = represents that the passage has some answer for the query,\n
but the answer may be a bit unclear, or hidden amongst extraneous\n
information and\n
1 = represents that the passage is dedicated to the query and\n
contains the exact answer.\n
Important Instruction: Assign category 0 if the passage is\n
somewhat related to the topic but not completely, category 1 if\n
passage presents something very important related to the entire\n
topic but also has some extra information and category 1 if the\n
passage only and entirely refers to the topic. If none of the\n
above satisfies give it category 0.\n
Query: $query\n
Passage: $passage\n
Split this problem into steps:\n
Consider the underlying intent of the search.\n
Measure how well the content matches a likely intent of the query\n
(M).\n
Measure how trustworthy the passage is (T).\n
Consider the aspects above and the relative importance of each,\n
and decide on a final score (O). Final score must be an integer\n
value only.\n
Do not provide any code in result. Provide each score in the\n
format of:\n
\n
##final score: score without providing any reasoning.\n
